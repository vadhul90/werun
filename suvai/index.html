        <h1>Suvai Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: May 5, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to Suvai, an offering of WeRun Consulting, the recipe app that helps you master your kitchen with recipes, AI-powered meal planning, cookbooks, OCR scanning, and more. By accessing or using Suvai (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms govern your use of Suvai, including all features such as recipe management, AI meal planning, OCR scanning, and cookbook creation. By creating an account or using the App, you confirm that you are at least 13 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and agree to these Terms. We may update these Terms periodically, and continued use constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Account Creation and Security</h2>
        <p>To access certain features, you must create an account using an email address or Apple Sign-In. You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing accurate and complete information during registration.</li>
            <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.</li>
            <li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use at <a href="mailto:suvai@werunconsulting.com">suvai@werunconsulting.com</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>WeRun Consulting reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</p>

        <h2>3. Subscription Plans and Payments</h2>
        <p>Suvai offers a free tier with up to 20 recipes and 5 OCR scans. Premium features (e.g., unlimited recipes, AI meal planning, advanced OCR) require a subscription:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscriptions are available monthly or yearly, billed through your App Store account.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions auto-renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the renewal date.</li>
            <li>No refunds are provided for unused subscription periods.</li>
            <li>If your subscription ends, you’ll have read-only access to view and export your recipes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Manage subscriptions via your App Store account. Pricing and terms are subject to change.</p>

        <h2>4. Use of AI Meal Planner and OCR</h2>
        <p>Suvai’s AI-powered meal planner generates personalized meal plans based on your preferences and dietary needs. The OCR feature scans recipes from photos or documents. You acknowledge:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AI-generated plans and OCR scans may not be 100% accurate and should be verified.</li>
            <li>You’re responsible for ensuring recipes and plans meet your dietary or health requirements.</li>
            <li>Data uploaded for OCR (e.g., recipe photos) is processed securely but not stored unless you save the recipe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Recipe and Cookbook Ownership</h2>
        <p>You retain ownership of recipes and cookbooks you create or upload. By uploading content, you grant Suvai, an offering of WeRun Consulting, a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to store, display, and process your content within the App. You agree not to upload content that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Infringes on third-party intellectual property rights.</li>
            <li>Is unlawful, offensive, or violates these Terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may share recipes with others via the App, but you’re responsible for ensuring you have permission to share third-party content.</p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Suvai, including its design, features, and content (excluding user-generated content), is owned by WeRun Consulting and protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. You may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy, modify, or distribute the App’s content without permission.</li>
            <li>Reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the App’s source code.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree to use Suvai for lawful purposes and not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upload malicious code or engage in activities that disrupt the App.</li>
            <li>Use the App to harass, defame, or harm others.</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to Suvai’s systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
        <p>WeRun Consulting may suspend or terminate your access to Suvai if you violate these Terms or for any reason, including account inactivity. Upon termination, your account data may be deleted, but you can export your recipes beforehand.</p>

        <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>Suvai is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. WeRun Consulting does not guarantee:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The accuracy or reliability of AI meal plans or OCR scans.</li>
            <li>Uninterrupted or error-free operation of the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, WeRun Consulting is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of Suvai, including but not limited to health issues from following recipes or meal plans.</p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia, without regard to conflict of law principles, except where prohibited by local law, in which case the laws of your jurisdiction may apply. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of Suvai will be resolved in the courts located in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, unless local law requires otherwise.</p>
