        <h1>Suvai Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: August 20, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to Suvai, an offering of WeRun Consulting, the recipe app that helps you master your kitchen with AI-generated meal plans, access to over 5000 recipes, and recipe collections. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of Suvai (the “App”) and supplement the End User License Agreement (EULA) provided by Apple at https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/. By accessing or using Suvai, you agree to be bound by these Terms and the EULA. For details on data handling, see our Privacy Policy at https://www.werunconsulting.com/suvai/privacy-policy.html. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Acknowledgement</h2>
        <p>You and WeRun Consulting acknowledge that these Terms are concluded between you and WeRun Consulting, not Apple, and WeRun Consulting is solely responsible for the App and its content, subject to the Apple EULA. These Terms do not conflict with the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions, which you acknowledge you have reviewed.</p>

        <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms govern your use of Suvai, including features like recipe management, AI meal planning, recipe collections, and Instacart integration. By creating an account or using the App, you confirm you are at least 13 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and agree to these Terms. We may update these Terms periodically, and continued use constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2>3. Account Creation and Security</h2>
        <p>To access certain features, you must create an account using an email address or Apple Sign-In. You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing accurate and complete information during registration.</li>
            <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.</li>
            <li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use at <a href="mailto:suvai@werunconsulting.com">suvai@werunconsulting.com</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>WeRun Consulting reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</p>

        <h2>4. Subscription Plans and Payments</h2>
        <p>Suvai offers a free tier with limited access to recipes and meal planning. Premium features require a subscription, such as Suvai Premium Monthly ($1.99/month) or Suvai Premium Yearly ($19.99/year). Subscriptions provide unlimited AI-generated meal plans and access to over 5000 recipes. Recipes can be organized into collections, but the App does not support cookbook creation. Subscriptions are billed through your App Store account and auto-renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the renewal date. No refunds are provided for unused subscription periods. If your subscription ends, you’ll have read-only access to view and export your recipes. Manage subscriptions via your App Store account. Pricing and terms are subject to change; see the in-app purchase screen for current details.</p>

        <h2>5. Use of AI Meal Planner and Instacart Integration</h2>
        <p>Suvai’s AI-powered meal planner generates personalized meal plans based on your preferences and dietary needs. For users in the US and Canada, the App integrates with the Instacart API to facilitate grocery ordering. You acknowledge:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Suvai is not a medical or health service and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or recommendations. AI-generated meal plans, recipes, and nutritional information are for informational and general educational purposes only and are not a substitute for professional medical, nutritional, or dietary advice from a qualified healthcare provider.</li>
            <li>You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy and suitability of any meal plans, recipes, or nutritional information for your personal health, dietary restrictions, allergies, or medical conditions. Suvai does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or safety of any generated content, and you use it at your own risk.</li>
            <li>WeRun Consulting disclaims any liability for physical harm, illness, injury, allergic reactions, or other health issues arising from following AI-generated meal plans or recipes. Always consult a doctor, nutritionist, or other healthcare professional before making dietary changes, especially if you have medical conditions, are pregnant, or are feeding children.</li>
            <li>Nutritional information (e.g., calories, macronutrients, micronutrients) provided in meal plans and recipes is sourced from publicly available databases and is approximate. Suvai does not independently verify or warrant this information. Key sources include:

You may share recipes with others via the App, but you’re responsible for ensuring you have permission to share third-party content.</p>

        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Suvai, including its design, features, and content (excluding user-generated content), is owned by WeRun Consulting and protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws.

        <h2>8. Acceptable Use</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>Use the App to harass, defame, or harm others.</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to Suvai’s systems.</li>
            <li>Violate applicable third-party terms (e.g., wireless data service agreements) when using the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Maintenance and Support</h2>
        <p>WeRun Consulting is solely responsible for providing maintenance and support services for the App, as specified in these Terms or required by law. You and WeRun Consulting acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance or support services for the App.</p>

        <h2>10. Warranty</h2>
        <p>The App is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind, to the extent permitted by law. WeRun Consulting is solely responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied. If the App fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price (if any) for the App. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple has no other warranty obligation, and any other claims, losses, or damages attributable to warranty failure are WeRun Consulting’s responsibility.</p>

        <h2>11. Product Claims</h2>
        <p>You and WeRun Consulting acknowledge that WeRun Consulting, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims relating to the App or your use of it, including product liability, legal compliance, or consumer protection claims.</p>

        <h2>12. Legal Compliance</h2>
        <p>You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo or designated as a “terrorist supporting” country, and you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

        <h2>13. Termination</h2>
        <p>These Terms are effective until terminated by you or WeRun Consulting. WeRun Consulting may suspend or terminate your access to Suvai if you violate these Terms or for any reason, including account inactivity. Upon termination, your account data may be deleted, but you can export your recipes beforehand.</p>

        <h2>14. Indemnity</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold WeRun Consulting, its officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from any claims, losses, or damages, including legal fees, arising from your use of the App, your content, or your violation of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia, without regard to conflict of law principles, except where prohibited by local law, in which case the laws of your jurisdiction may apply. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of Suvai will be resolved in the courts located in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, unless local law requires otherwise.</p>

        <h2>16. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

        <h2>17. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms, together with the Apple EULA and our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and WeRun Consulting regarding your use of Suvai and supersede any prior agreements.</p>

        <h2>18. Third-Party Beneficiary</h2>
        <p>You and WeRun Consulting acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</p>
