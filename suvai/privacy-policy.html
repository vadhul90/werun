        <h1>Suvai Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: May 5, 2025</p>

        <p>Suvai, an offering of WeRun Consulting, is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information when you use Suvai (the "App"), a recipe app featuring AI-powered meal planning, ingredient dictionary, recipes, and more. By using the App, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following types of information to provide and improve Suvai’s services:</p>

            <li><strong>User-Generated Content</strong>: Recipes and meal plan preferences you create or upload are stored locally on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not monitor or collect usage data, such as how you interact with the App or device information. We do not collect sensitive personal information (e.g., health data) unless voluntarily provided in meal plan preferences, and we do not use it for purposes beyond personalization.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use your information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide and personalize Suvai’s features, such as generating AI-powered meal plans and storing recipes locally on your device.</li>
            <li>Authenticate your account and ensure security.</li>
            <li>Communicate with you about updates, promotions, or support issues (e.g., via email).</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations, such as responding to lawful requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>WeRun Consulting does not sell or share your personal information with third parties, except in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We use trusted providers (e.g., cloud storage for account data) to process data on our behalf, under strict confidentiality agreements.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose data to comply with legal obligations, such as court orders or regulatory requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: If WeRun Consulting is acquired or merged, your data may be transferred to the new entity, with continued privacy protections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>User-generated content, such as recipes and meal plans, is stored locally on your device and is not shared with us or third parties.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>

        <h2>5. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights under laws like the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) or GDPR:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access</strong>: Request a copy of your personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Correction</strong>: Request updates to inaccurate data.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion</strong>: Request deletion of your data, subject to legal retention obligations.</li>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal information (email address and username) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services. If you delete your account, we will remove your data within 60 days, except where required for legal or audit purposes. User-generated content stored locally on your device can be managed or deleted by you directly.</p>

        <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Suvai is operated from Australia, and your account data may be stored or processed in Australia or other countries where our service providers operate (e.g., cloud servers in the USA).
