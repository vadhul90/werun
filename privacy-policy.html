        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: April 13, 2025</em></p>

        <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>WeRun Consulting is the data controller responsible for the personal data collected through our website, <a href="https://werunconsulting.com">werunconsulting.com</a>. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

        <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following personal data when you use our contact form:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Name</strong>: To address you personally in our response.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Address</strong>: To reply to your inquiry.</li>
            <li><strong>Message</strong>: To understand and address your query or request.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Why We Collect It</h2>
        <p>We collect this data solely to respond to inquiries submitted via our contact form. The data is processed through EmailJS, a third-party service, to facilitate the delivery of your message to our team and to send you a response.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>To process your inquiry, we use EmailJS, which receives the data you submit through our contact form (name, email, and message). EmailJS processes this data to deliver your message to us and enable our response. For details on how EmailJS handles your data, please refer to their <a href="https://www.emailjs.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p>We do not share your personal data with any other third parties, except as required by law.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>WeRun Consulting does not retain your personal data beyond the time required to process and respond to your inquiry. However, EmailJS may store your data as per their retention policies, which are outlined in their <a href="https://www.emailjs.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. We recommend reviewing their policy for more information.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access</strong>: Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Rectification</strong>: Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion</strong>: Request deletion of your personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Restriction</strong>: Request that we limit the processing of your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Objection</strong>: Object to the processing of your data for specific purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since your data is processed by EmailJS, some rights (e.g., deletion or access) may need to be exercised directly with them, as outlined in their <a href="https://www.emailjs.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. We will assist you to the best of our ability in coordinating with EmailJS to fulfill your requests.</p>
